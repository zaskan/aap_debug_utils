# Migrations.
# The purpose of migrations is to handle a case where we made a change
# to how we expect the controller to be configured, and upgrading the controller needs
# to move the the controller instance to the new state.
#
# Some migration tasks may be very simple, and others very complex; in order
# to maintain readability, *this* file should maintain a strict pattern
# of "condition, include, condition, include, condition, include...".
#
# Essentially, this file should set up a condition to check to see if a given
# migration needs to be done, and then include another task file that does
# it, regardless of whether the number of steps is 1 or 25.
